# Dataset: historical and concurrent data on a two-way combination

One of two datasets from the application described in Neuenschwander et
al (2016). In the study `trial_AB`, the risk of DLT was studied as a
function of dose for two drugs, drug A and drug B. Historical
information on the toxicity profiles of these two drugs is available
from single agent trials `trial_A` and `trial_B`. Another study `IIT`
was run concurrently to `trial_AB`, and studies the same combination. A
second dataset `hist_combo2` is available from this example, which
includes only the data from the single agent studies, prior to the
initiation of `trial_AB` and `IIT`.

## Usage

``` r
codata_combo2
```

## Format

A data frame with 20 rows and 5 variables:

- group_id:

  study

- drug_A:

  dose of Drug A

- drug_B:

  dose of Drug B

- num_patients:

  number of patients

- num_toxicities:

  number of DLTs

- cohort_time:

  cohort number of patients
